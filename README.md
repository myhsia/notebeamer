## Note template imitated from Goodnotes made by LaTeX
###### Author: [Axia](mailto:xiamyphys@gmail.com)
#### Introduction
In order to improve the efficiency of taking notes on iPad in class and focus more on the teacher's lecture rather than taking notes, we developed this one-click template for importing courseware. The left side is the courseware and the right side is the annotation area.

At the same time, the cover of the note is modeled on Goodnotes, and the title, author, and email address can be customized.

#### Designs
Note paper provides two options, namely `beamer` and `slidev`

##### `beamer` option
This option is suitable for courseware with a screen ratio of approximately 4:3 and is designed to be **three beamers per page**.

##### `slidev` option
This option is suitable for courseware with a screen ratio of approximately 16:9 and is designed to be **four beamers per page**.

##### blank page
Supports generating left and right equal-width double-column blank pages

##### Cover design
Based on the official Goodnotes, several other color covers have been added.

|Options|Color|Options|Color|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|1Âè∑Ëâ≤|Green|5Âè∑Ëâ≤|Purple|
